Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

The python version of SplAdder does not require any installation process. In can
be used as is, given that the following dependencies are fulfilled:

* pysam
* h5py
* scipy

These are standard packages and the authors suggest to use a python package
manager such as anaconda.

To start SplAdder and see a list of all available options, use:

```
python spladder.py
```

Example Data
------------

To check if your SplAdder installation is working and all dependencies are met,
we provide a test script that computes the results on example data. If not done
yet, the example data, will be downloaded from a remote location.

Please invoke ```example_run.sh``` to start the test procedure.
