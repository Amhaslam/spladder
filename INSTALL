Please run the configure script by invoking:
    ./configure

In gerenal, there are three different options for installing. With the option
-m, the installer attempts to automatically install SplAdder in a Matlab
environment. With the option -o, the installer attempts to automatically install
SplAdder in an Octave environment. In case the autamitc installation attempt
fails or you want to influence which dependencies are used, you have to use the
interactive installation mode by choosing option -i.
